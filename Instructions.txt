I attached a concept I would like to propose you work on..
 
Please do not worry about the header, breadcrumbs, page title, box ("To report any emergency…”) elements.
 
I am looking for you to build the main DIV container with the. It is composed of 12 large button elements (i.e.: REPORTING EMERGENCIES).
 
If you would like, you can leverage a framework (Foundation but Bootstrap is similar) which would enable you to leverage pre-existing functionalities/effects like the hovers and accordion effect, but feel free to code it with Js.
 
You also do not have to worry about the colors of the buttons, or font styles, black and gray will work, arial as the font family is fine.
 
Finally, you do have to worry about the copy represented in the PDF, you can use dummy copy.
 
The blocks have effects: on hover or click, their state changes. 
When one of 4 buttons in any of the 3 rows is clicked, the state of the block changes and text related to the block is revealed.
 
The page should be responsive, feel free to come up with a layout that works for mobile phones and tablets, it doesn’t have to be perfect, we just want to get a feel for how you would proceed with this in the code base.
 
If you could give us access to a preview of code by December 8, we’ll review your approach, coding best practices and get back to you the following week.
 
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.
 
Thanks,
Damien
